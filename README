/etc/pam.d/sshd or /etc/pam.d/system-auth:

[...]
auth sufficient pam_url.so [debug] [config=/etc/pam_url.conf]
[...]

This line forms the following url encoded POST data:
user=<username>&passwd=<pass>&mode=<PAM_AUTH|PAM_ACCT|PAM_SESS|PAM_PASS>&PSK=secret&do=auth
It should return either 200 OK with PSK in the body or 403 Forbidden if unsuccessful.

You can additionally set the following options:

    use_first_pass      Use the password previously used in the pam stack
    prepend_first_pass  Prepend the password previously used in the pam stack
                        (This is a handy option in totpcgi deployments when you want
                        to be able to pass both the password and the token code to the
                        verification server. It's probably not useful for any other
                        purpose.)

Please take a look inside the examples directory.
Please read the COPYING, INSTALL and AUTHOR files as well.
